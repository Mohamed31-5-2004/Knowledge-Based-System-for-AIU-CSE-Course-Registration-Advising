## Recommendation Engine

The system uses an **expert system (rule-based engine)** via the [experta](https://github.com/noxdafox/experta) library to:

- Apply credit limits based on CGPA:
  - **CGPA â‰¥ 3.5:** Up to 22 credit hours
  - **2.0 â‰¤ CGPA < 3.5:** Up to 20 credit hours
  - **CGPA < 2.0:** Up to 13 credit hours
- Recommend courses only if prerequisites and co-requisites are satisfied
- Ensure failed courses are prioritized for retake if eligible
- Provide explanations for all recommendations and restrictions

---

## Customization

- **Course Data:** Edit or replace `Corrected_CSE_Courses3ver2.csv` with your institution's course list.
- **Admin Password:** Change the password by updating the `admin123` string in the `check_password` function.
- **Styling:** Modify custom CSS in the code for UI enhancements.
